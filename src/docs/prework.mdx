# Refugees Code Prework

## Introduction

Welcome to [Madrid For Refugees Coding Bootcamp](https://madridforrefugees.org/es/la-organizacion/mfr-coding-es/)!  From now on we'll try to guide you through the fundamentals of web development with the main and only purpose that **you can land a job in the IT industry**. We'll do our best to help you get a job, but it will also require a lot of work from your side. Bear in mind that we are here to help you, but **it depends on your work and motivation**.

With the intention that you don't begin the course with no knowledge at all, we've prepared this 
short introduction to the technologies you'll be using throughout the classes. If through the course of these slides, exercises and explanations you don't understand something, **PLEASE** üôèüèº ask your teacher or mentor, they will be glad to help you on our [Slack Channel](https://mfrcodingproject.slack.com/).

**We expect you to follow the lessons with care**. Try to be creative doing the work you are assigned to ensure that you fully understand what you just read. We expect you to be curious and a little daring. Nobody will get hurt if you try something to see what happens. You will gain many new insights if you do.

**Don't be scared to ask questions**. We encourage you to be creative trying to find answers to problems. We are also here to dispel any doubts you may get stuck with. Get used to the idea of asking questions when you are stumped.

Every module will have a page looking similar to this one: 

1. There will be a short **Introduction** summarizing the scope of the module.
2. It will be followed by a **Goals** section listing more precisely the skills and concepts we expect to have covered at the end of it.
3. A **Basic Tools** section will enumerate the different technologies / applications / tools that will be needed for the success of the module.
4. Then, there will be **some content sections,** particular to the module you are in. You must read and watch its resources and respond to questions related to what it has been explained.
5. To keep you in shape, there will be some **Exercises** proposed for you to accomplish, that your teacher will ask you to do.
6. Finally, there will be a **Further Reading** section, where you will find some more advanced contents that can be interesting for you to read, but are not mandatory.

We will ask you to **review exercises from time to time with your teacher**. We do this to get a clearer picture of how well you are grasping the basic concepts. Likewise, we want to be able to react quickly to help you if it seems like you are struggling. **Do not be afraid of showing your work, you‚Äôre not being graded on it**. The more we know about your progress the better.

We also encourage collaboration to a certain extent. Feel free to **chat with your fellow classmates and share ideas about how to do things**. In programming there is rarely only a single solution to a problem, so it can be very beneficial to talk about the possible solutions to a problem, such as you will do in a job environment. However, **please do the assignments by yourself** and avoid copying. That way we can know more accurately how well you understand something.

## Goals

By the end of this prework introduction, you should:

- [ ]  Understand and accept our Code of Conduct
- [ ]  Learn basics of how the web works and a bit of its fascinating history
- [ ]  Understand what is a front-end developer and what are the responsibilities of the role
- [ ]  Assimilate what a filesystem is
- [ ]  Get to know your operating system: Ubuntu
- [ ]  Learn the basic commands of a Command Line Interface
- [ ]  Learn how to use a modern text editor like Visual Studio Code
- [ ]  Understand how to work with a version management system as Git

Sound quite challenging, doesn't it? Don't be daunted by it, you'll always have the support of the teachers and the full team of Refugees Code. Let's go!

## Basic tools

To carry out the Prework you won't need anything special, just ensure that you have a modern browser installed. We especially recommend downloading the [**Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) browser**. This special edition of the Firefox browser incorporates tools specifically designed for developers, as well as incorporating the latest web standards and experimental features.

Ensure that your computer is using **Ubuntu** as an operating system and has installed a text editor as **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**. We will read about them later, but will be part of this course and required in the upcoming modules.

## Contents

In the Prework you won't have to do any exercises at the end of each topic, however you will find a test at the end that we need you to answer (you will find more information once you get to that part).

### Code Of Conduct

Please, read our Code of Conduct. It is very important to us that you know what we expect from you and what we require everyone involved in this course. At the beginning of the course we will ask you to sign it.

### How the web works

By now we should all have realized that the Internet has affected almost every aspect of our lives as a society. It is present in the businesses, in the health system, in the educational entities, in the services... But it is still a bit mysterious how it works behind the scenes for most of the people using it. Since you are willing to be part of the Doers of the Internet, let's discover a bit closer how it works :)

### Front-end developer

The purpose of this bootcamp is to help you become a Front-end developer, but, do you really know what it does mean? Take a minute to think about it.

The following resources have been selected to give you more context on what a Front-end developer does, the resources they can make use of and in summary, a bit more of what you can expect to start understanding during this bootcamp!

Please, **read from this summary the chapters 1 and 2.1**. Do not worry about the rest, because you don't need them now :)

üìñ  [What Is a Front-end Developer?](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/#2)

üìñ [Baseline Web Technologies Employed by Front-End Developers](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/#3.3)

üìñ [Front-End on a Team](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/#3.6)

Do not worry if you don't understand it all... What makes a developer, is learning! Read about it in the next post!

### Filesystem

These are basic introductory videos to what files and folders - also called directories - are and how we can use them. If you already have experience with them, feel free to skip this part, but we encourage you to take a look at them!

üìΩ  **[Basic file management system - Pt 1 - Concepts & Extensions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-EID5_2D9U)**

üìΩ  **[Basic file management system - Pt 2 - Nesting & Sorting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGd48PGbnBs)**

The look and feel of what you'll see in these videos might not be exactly the same you'll find in your computer. Don't worry, the idea is the same :)

### Ubuntu

Ubuntu is the operating system (OS) you are going to use in RefugeesCode course. It is widely used in the technical scene and very flexible. Get to know it a little more!

Again, it is not needed you understand everything that here is mentioned, but try to get familiar with its concepts and possibilities.

### Terminal

Prepare to get used to this powerful tool because it is one of the most spread among developers and as soon as you start using it you will understand why! With very few commands you will be able to do HUGE things across many operating systems, in your computer or in a remote server. 

The following resources will give you a summary of what the terminal is and some commands you can get the most of!

### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a text editor specifically created to be used with programming languages. It is easy to integrate with other tools we will use, as git.

Take a a first look to its appearance and the potential it has:

## Prework test

Congrats to get up to here! You are doing awesome üöÄ  By now you have gone through how the Web works, what a Front-end Developer mission is and got to know some of the technical tools that will go by your side in this journey: Ubuntu (Linux), Command Line Interface (CLI) and VS Code (as text editor).

Now it is time to ask you to prove a bit of your learnings with a short test. Do not worry if you don't know the perfect answer for every question, we just want you to **do it the best you can and encourage you to review the materials** for those questions that you find more difficulties answering. You can take it as many times as you want to.
