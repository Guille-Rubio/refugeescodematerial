# First steps

Hi there! üëãüèΩ

**Welcome to the beginning of this journey into web development.** Before delving into more complex stuff, we think it‚Äôs super important that you get familiarized with one of the most fundamental tools you need for programming on the web, HTML.

HTML stands for *Hypertext Markup Language*, and it is actually pretty simple. It is primarily used to structure your document considering the semantic meaning each element is going to have in it (Is it a paragraph, a heading? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?),  the distribution of it from a logical perspective (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?) and the embed content it might have (Is it going to contain an image, a piece of audio or a video?).

We don't want to start boring you with the history of it, and there's plenty of documentation on the internet about its origin, so briefly quoting Wikipedia, we'll just say that HTML was born in 1989, when Tim Berners-Lee (considered *the father* of the web) wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. From there, the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995 completed `HTML 2.0` the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.

And enough talk! Now let's see what we expect from you while learning everything this incredible world has to offer. Off we go!

## Goals

This is just an illustrative list to show you what should you have learned by the end of this section. It would be nice if before crossing each one of them out, you could repeat out loud or do by yourself what it is written in the list. Don't worry though if some are too abstract, or you need help. Remember that you will have the time and people to ask any doubt you might have.

- [ ]  Learn and understand how to use basic tags
- [ ]  How to place comments in HTML
- [ ]  Nest tags and understand its relationship
- [ ]  Use hyperlinks to navigate from one document to another
- [ ]  Insert images in an HTML document
- [ ]  Create a semantic layout in HTML
- [ ]  Create a fully working form with HTML

## Basic tools

To carry out the activities in this module you can use any modern web browser. Just as a reminder, we recommend you download the Mozilla web browser, as we mentioned in the prework module. Of course, feel free to use any browser you feel more comfortable with, this is just a recommendation considering that we're going to be developing for the web.

Apart from that, [you'll need to have in your computer some IDE to write your code](https://www.notion.so/Refugees-Code-Prework-bf2f2c44f7f44a3f869dfb8a06349b60). You should have done this in the prework module, so in case you haven't done it yet, just refer to that part of the material and install it now.

And last but not least, you'll need to create an account in [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). This website offers several courses in web development for free with tons and materials and exercises. You'll be doing lots of exercises there, so it's better if you have an account to track your progress!

## Contents

## 01. Introduction to HTML

### Introduction

Watch these couple of videos as an introduction to HTML. Don't worry if some things don't make a lot of sense, everything will sink in eventually.

üìΩ [What is HTML?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yIf_mYvprk)

üìΩ CSS Tricks: [HTML & CSS - The VERY Basics](https://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/58-html-css-the-very-basics/)

Read this article until "Understanding Common CSS Terms" to get a general view of HTML. Don't worry if you don't understand, we'll go back to this later.

üìñ [Building your first web page](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/#common-html-terms)

### Tags

Read these articles about HTML tags:

üìñ [HTML Basic tags](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html-course-basics-of-html/?ref=rp)

üìñ [A list of the 12 most common tags](https://learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/basic-tags-intro-to-html-tagging-in-elearning-content)

- Can you explain what is a tag?
- And what is the difference with an element?
- Review the tags list and find one that looks interesting, what is it for?

### Nested tags

Tags can be nested inside other tags. To maintain readable code, the parent tags (the outermost ones) should each be on a new line with the nested element indented. This is just for reading purposes, since the browser doesn't care about how your code is indented. However, you should get used to write it so you and anyone who might read it later can understand what's happening in a glance. Read the following articles to dive deeper into nesting tags:

üìñ [How to nest HTML elements](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-nest-html-elements)

üìñ [Nesting HTML tags](https://www.lifewire.com/nesting-html-tags-3466475)

- Why is nesting so important in HTML?
- Is your CSS going to improve if you nest your HTML?

### Comments

Comments are an important (and polemic) topic in software programming. The comments speak from themselves. They're just pieces of code that are **commented** out and are not interpreted by the browser whatsoever. Their only purpose is to serve as annotations to you or anyone who might read the code later. We won't start now the argument on whether you should use them or not. However, you should definitely know how to write them. Read the following articles to find out how:

üìñ [HTML comment tag](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/html-comment-tag)

üìñ [The HTML Comment Tag: Here‚Äôs How To Use It In Your Code](https://html.com/tags/comment-tag/)

Now you know how to comment your code:

- Could you explain why comments are important?
- Can you think of advantages and disadvantages of using comments in your applications?

## 02. HTML structure and basic tags

### The HTML tag

The HTML tag is the tag that rules them all. It is the only tag that needs to be in every HTML document. No matter what the content of that document is, there has to be an `<html>` and `</html>` in it.

üìñ [The HTML element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html)

### The HEAD tag

The head tag is a bit trickier, since it actually contains metadata that will not be displayed on the page, and it only serves information to the browser that the user won't be aware of.

üìñ [Anatomy of a web page - The head element](https://espirian.co.uk/html-introduction/#head-element)

üìñ [Anatomy of the head in HTML5](https://www.dummies.com/web-design-development/html5/anatomy-of-the-head-in-html5/)

- Why is the `<head>` tag so important?
- What's the main difference between the `<head>` and the `<body>` tags?

### HTML Landmarks

HTML landmarks are tags in your page to define areas like the main content or a navigation region. It defines semantically the website and also helps users using assistive technologies to navigate comfortably through the website.

Landmarks define the outer structure of our website, defining the areas of the page based on its responsibility

The following readings are a bit longer than usual, but once you've gone through it, you'll be able to understand much better how layouts are built in HTML and what's the purpose of some of the most important tags in the language.

üìñ [Semantics provide meaning](https://www.accessibility-developer-guide.com/knowledge/semantics/meaning/)

üìñ [Document and website structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure)

- What are semantic tags?
- Why are they important when building your layout?

### HTML Text formatting

One of HTML's main jobs is to give text structure and meaning (also known as semantics) so that a browser can display it correctly. This article explains the way HTML can be used to structure a page of text by adding headings and paragraphs, emphasizing words, creating lists, and more.

üìñ [HTML text fundamentals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals)

üìñ [HTML text tags](https://flaviocopes.com/html-text-tags/)

- How many `<h1>` tags should be in your document? And `<h2>`?
- What's the difference between a `<p>` tag and a `<span>` tag?

## 03. HTML advanced elements and properties

### HTML attributes

An attribute extends a tag, changing its behavior or providing metadata. An attribute always has the form `name=value` (the attribute's identifier followed by its associated value).

üìΩ [HTML | Attributes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIWmPL91Dn4)

üìñ [HTML Attributes](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/html-tutorial/html-attributes.php)

- What are attributes for?
- How are attributes formed?

### Hyperlinks

A basic link (that is, some element that you can click to be redirected to another website or section in your document) is created by wrapping the text (or other content) you want to turn into a link inside an `<a>` element, and giving it an `href` attribute (also known as a Hypertext Reference, or target) that will contain the web address you want the link to point to.

You can read more about hyperlinks in these articles and watch the video below:

üìñ [Creating Hyperlinks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks)

üìñ [A Complete Guide to Links and Buttons](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-links-and-buttons/)

üìΩ [How to create links in HTML](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiSvq5SgLMI&ab_channel=DaniKrossing)

### Images

The HTML `<img>` element embeds an image into the document. Formats could be,`.jpg` `.gif`, `.png` or `.svg`. You'll learn later what a `.svg` file is, and how it can be used together with the `<svg>` tag. For now, read these articles to get a solid foundation on how images work on the web:

üìñ [HTML Image Tag](https://www.bitdegree.org/learn/html-image-tag)

üìñ [MDN: img: The Image Embed Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img)

üìñ [HTML Tags Guide To Adding Images To Your Web Documents](https://html.com/tags/img/)

### SVG

SVG is a special format for rendering images on the web that differs greatly from what we are used to with normal formats like `.jpg` or `.png` . These images are formed with vectors instead of pixels, unleashing a whole new range of possibilities for image and data visualization on the web. It can seem daunting at first, and it is, it's a complex topic and there are lots to know about it. Don't worry though, we've prepared a selection of readings that will guide you through it. Remember to ask your mentor if you have any doubts at all. Good reading!

üìñ [What Is an SVG File? SVG Image and Tags Explained](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/svg-basics-what-are-scalable-vector-graphics-and-how-do-you-use-them/)

üìñ [How to Use SVG Images in CSS and HTML ‚Äì A Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-svg-images-in-css-html/)

5. [Turn an Image into a Link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-html-and-html5/turn-an-image-into-a-link)

## 04. HTML forms

We've covered basic HTML elements and attributes. We already know how to create static semantic HTML websites, display information, link pages, etc. Now, we will add a very important part of HTML: forms.

Forms are essential to interact and gather data from the user, and it's very important to use semantically correct forms. The data gathered in a form is usually sent to a server, but nowadays, it can be used in JavaScript to create interaction. Don't worry about this now, you'll learn about this in the following modules.

A form is made of multiple HTML elements: labels, text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, buttons...etc

üìñ [HTML Forms](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/html-tutorial/html-forms.php)

üìñ [HTML Web Forms Tutorial For Coding Beginners](https://html.com/forms/)

Now watch this video to see how a form is actually built into a website:

üìΩ [HTML Forms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuKFsFNtZJg)

One of the resources that appears on the video is from MDN, as always, this should be one of your reference guides when looking for information in web development. We'll add the link at the end of the section, in case you want to dive deeper into forms.

## HTML Section projects

Well! Congratulations! You reached the end of the first section. Hopefully you feel like you learned a ton already but still you have the feeling that there's so much more to learn. And that's right. This is a feeling that accompanies us all, whether you have 0 or 20 years of experience. But that's a good thing! And sure it's exciting üòÑ.

Now that you know a little more about HTML, we've linked here a couple of projects from freeCodeCamp. They're quite similar to the exercises you've done before, but they should take you a little more time to complete. We'll include these projects at the end of each section. They'll be related to the topic you have learned in each case, to make sure you've grasped everything we need you to know to complete this course.

As always, even though it is better for you if you try to complete the exercise on your own, don't hesitate to ask any of the staff (or even better, your classmates!) if you get stuck. We're here to help!

Good luck! And we really hope you enjoy making these projects!

**HTML Tables**

Tables are used in HTML documents to present tabular data. The reason why we haven't dedicated a whole chapter in this material to show you how to build them it's because they are becoming less and less used in favor of other technologies such as Flexbox and CSS Grid (don't worry about this, you'll learn what these are later on). However, we still think it's valuable and interesting that you know them, since, as in everything, there may be situations where you could still use them.

**HTML emails**

You want your emails to look good in every environment. Especially nowadays, when roughly half of all emails is opened on a mobile device, responsive design is essential to commercial email senders. In this article, we'll show you the basic principle of making a responsive HTML email using CSS Media Queries and provide you with an example. Even though we haven't taught you CSS yet, go and read the following article to know more about how emails are coded nowadays.
