## Introduction

Components are one of the most powerful features of Vue.js. They help you extend basic HTML elements to encapsulate reusable code. Components can be reused as many times as you want or used in another component, making it a child component. As an example, if your component is a button, you can use it as many times as you want, and you won't need to write the button each time. Imagine a puzzle, using components is like creating pieces of your app like, menus, buttons, sidebars, etc. and the using this pieces to build a full app.


## Goals

- [ ]  Creating and reusing components
- [ ]  Organize an application with multiple components
- [ ]  Passing data between components

## Basic tools

Understanding the concept of component is not easy, but is a common feature in every JS framework out there, from the trendy ReactJS to the mature Ember. A component is a piece of code that wraps everything we have seen so far. From HTML structure to API connection, a component is just a small piece of everything you learned so far that, combined with other components, can develop a rich application. It sound scary at the beggining, but you will get used to it and will love it.
